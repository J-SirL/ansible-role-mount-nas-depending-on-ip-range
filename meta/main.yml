    The `mount_nas_depending_on_ip_range` is an Ansible role designed to simplify the setup
    of a Network Attached Storage (NAS) mount script as a Systemd service triggered by network
    changes, with configuration depending on IP address ranges. This role automates the
    configuration of the NAS mount script, Systemd service, and NetworkManager dispatcher script,
    allowing you to mount NAS shares based on specific IP address ranges, enhancing security and flexibility.
